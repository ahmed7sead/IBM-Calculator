# IBM Calculator

This is a simple IBM-style calculator I made while learning JavaScript.  
The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it works on all screen sizes.

## Features
- Basic math operations  
- Calculation history  
- Smooth animations  
- Fully responsive design  

## Purpose
I built this project to practice JavaScript logic, equations, and making an interactive web page.
